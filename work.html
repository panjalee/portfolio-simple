    <p> What are my proudest work accomplishments? I've always been interested in fusing my expertise in marketing
        and UX in the tech industry whether it is in big tech, FinTech, or EdTech. 
        Last summer I worked at PayPal, here's what I did: Adopted primary customer segments into a targeted 
        outbound email marketing campaign positioning a product to user types, resulting in 802k 
        accounts attributed to the crypto feature. Innovated an in-app digital experience and bonus rewards program 
        considering Venmo and PayPal credit card competitor analyses and revolving credit expansion strategy, creating a
        forecasted P&L with 6% program ROA and $200k+ 5-year cryptocurrency halo.
        Designed a go-to-market strategy and pricing for subscription management and cryptocurrency
        features upon card launch implementing evergreen marketing, projecting a 8% TPV lift.

    <p> I'm also super passionate about working within the community and helping local nonprofits with their 
        digital marketing. In previous years, I was an Account Director leading a team of students to consult 
        for local nonprofits and small businesses through an on campus club, Michigan Advertising and Marketing. 
        Hence these interests and expriences, led me to the Google Community Leaders Program where I have: 
        Researched 150+ non-profits to develop a database for application outreach and acceptance
        into the CLP Non-Profit Academy, improving 6 non-profits digital marketing using Google tools.
        Learned fundamentals of Google tools and digital inclusion, resulting in over 14+ hours of
        training including mentorship from Googlers and certifications in Google Ads and Analytics.
        Started workshops for non-profits utilizing Grow with Google materials, anticipating over 90%
        increase in online presence including Google Knowledge Panel verification for organizations.
