    <p> My love for cooking and eating healthy, with sweet treats here and there of course, 
        all started in middle school. Ever since then my favorite dish to eat is greek salad, 
        simply because the flavors of the dressing with the crunch of lettuce, and soft garbanzo 
        beans make a harmonious meal. It is such a satiating meal for me, and can be eaten at any time: morning or evening.

    </p>
    <p> Food has always been an important part of my lifestyle. It intrigues me how much opportunity 
        we are given to work with so many different ingredients: the world is our oyster with the 
        amount of possibilities we can create. That's why here, I have shared some of my favorite creations and go to meals.
