    <p> What is the subject of my photography? Travel. Why Travel? Travel is often 
    known as the only thing you buy that makes you richer. Since I was about 
    5 years old I've had the opportunity to travel to places 
    far beyond what my imagination could have dreamt up. 
    This built up my ardor to travel, learn more, and immerse myself within 
    the cultures of countless cities across the world.  
    </p>
    <p> Why am I so passionate about it? My experiences have fueled my wanderlust; I am so passionate about travel 
        because it has made me appreciate how unique each and everyone one of us is. 
        More importantly, travel has taught me both the hardships across different 
        regions, but also the value of becoming aware of the world we live in. 
        The value in travel shouldn't be limited just to certain individuals though, 
        and sharing the enrichment of travel with my friends, family, acquaintances, 
        and beyond is equally a part of my passion. I strive to integrate many of 
        the values I learn through these experiences into my daily work and personal 
        life all while sharing the joy of travel. By doing so, I want to create an 
        environment of appreciation and inclusion. Whether it is trying street food in 
        Giza, Egypt, or appreciating the sheer beauty of the Incan Citadel Machu Picchu 
        in Peru, I hope to continue to pursue my passion for travel in the future and 
        appreciate our amazing earth.
